config/; Contains configuration for your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in Configuring Rails Applications.

db/; Contains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.

package.json; This file allows you to specify what npm dependencies are needed for your Rails application. This file is used by Yarn. For more information about Yarn, see the <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/">Yarn website</a>.
